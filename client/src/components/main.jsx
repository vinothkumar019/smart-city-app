      <h1>ðŸŽ¯ Smart City Complaint Management System</h1>
      <p>
        This project is a <strong>web-based Smart City Complaint Management System</strong> that allows citizens to
        report issues like <em>potholes, water leakage, streetlight faults, pollution</em>, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system ensures that these complaints are visible to city officials in real-time,
        who can then take timely action.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is built using the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and provides separate dashboards
        for <strong>users (citizens)</strong> and <strong>admins (city staff)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens can submit complaints with <strong>images and location</strong>,
        and officials can <strong>track, filter, and resolve</strong> them efficiently.
      </p>

      <button onClick={handleLogout} style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
